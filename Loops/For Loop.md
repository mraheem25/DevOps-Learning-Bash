# For Loops
### For loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of values and perform repetitive tasks. They are a powerful tool for automating operations and processing data. For loops enable you to repeat a block of code for a specific number of iterations.

#### Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for variable in [ seq ]
do
  #Code block to be executed
done
```
