## Learning Jounrey

I began my bash scripting journey by understanding the following concpets: variables, parameters, conditionals, loops and functions. I then wrote and executed bash scripts covering these concepts. I improved my scripts through error handling, which invloved taking proactive measures by utilising exit codes and shell options. A key skill developed through Bash Scripting was problem solving. In order to complete tasks, I often needed to break the task down and use comments - making it easier to keep track of my script.
